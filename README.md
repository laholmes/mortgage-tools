amortization_table(loan_amount: float, rate: float, monthly_payment: float)
takes an initial loan amount, a fixed rate, and monthly payment, and returns  
the amortization table for the loan, showing monthly capital and interest repayment.  
term is calculated based on period required to fully amortize the loan.  

Assume monthly compounding, payments made at end of month i.e. interest accrues in period, followed by  
monthly payment to cancel interest and reduce outstanding capital.
